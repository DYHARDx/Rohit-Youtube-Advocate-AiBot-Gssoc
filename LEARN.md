## 🌐 Frontend (React + Vite)

This project uses **React with Vite** for fast bundling.

### Key Concepts:
- Components under `/src/components`
- Page-based routing via `/src/pages`
- Entry point: `main.jsx` and `App.jsx`

### Resources:
- 📘 [React Official Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- 🚀 [Vite Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- 🎨 [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

---

## 🧠 Backend (Python + FAISS)

The backend uses **Flask** or **FastAPI** for API and **FAISS** for vector search.

### Key Files:
- `main.py`: Starts the server and handles API routes
- `embeddings.py`: Handles vector DB and similarity search

### Resources:
- 🧬 [Flask Docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- ⚡ [FastAPI Docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- 🔍 [FAISS Docs (Facebook AI)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)

## 🚀 Tutorials & Starters

- [FAISS Starter Example](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Getting-started)
- [Python FastAPI Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA)

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep React components modular
- Write clean APIs (use FastAPI’s `pydantic` if applicable)
- Document new endpoints in this file
- Keep `embeddings.py` optimized for vector performance
- Use `.env` for API keys and secrets (never commit them)
